    <p class="lead text-left text-info"><strong>A fully mature kadam tree can reach up to 45&nbsp;m (148&nbsp;ft) in height. It is a large tree with a broad crown and straight cylindrical bole. It is quick growing, with broad spreading branches and grows rapidly in the first 6–8 years. The trunk has a diameter of 100–160&nbsp;cm, but typically less than that. Leaves are 13–32&nbsp;cm (5.1–12.6&nbsp;in) long. Flowering usually begins when the tree is 4–5 years old. Kadam&nbsp;flowers are sweetly fragrant, red to orange in colour, occurring in dense, globular heads of approximately 5.5&nbsp;cm (2.2&nbsp;in) diameter. The fruit of&nbsp;<em>N. cadamba</em> occur in small, fleshy capsules packed closely together to form a fleshy yellow-orange infructescence containing approximately 8000 seeds. On maturing, the fruit splits apart, releasing the seeds, which are then dispersed by wind or rain </strong></p>
    <p class="lead text-left text-info"><b>Taxonomy <br>The species has been the subject of a long  debate, beginning in the 1930s. The problem arose because scientific names are based on. In 1785  described a specimen under the name <em>Cephalanthus chinensis</em>, stating that it came created the
    name <em>Anthocephalus indicus</em>, stating that the species came from Asia and that his description was based on the same specimen as Lamarck&#39;s <em>Cephalanthus chinensis</em>. (Under the rules of the  Richard should have used the name <em>A. chinensis</em>    rather than <em>A. indicus</em>, as he should not have changed the specific epithet.)The issue is whether Richard was indeed using the same specimen as Lamarck; the geographical origin is said to be different, and the descriptions do not match; for
    example in Lamarck&#39;s <em>Cephalanthus chinensis</em> the whereas in Richard&#39;s <em>Anthocephalus</em> they are terminal. If specimens were the same, then <em>Anthocephalus</em> is a synonym of the Madagascan <em>Cephalanthus</em> and cannot
    be a generic name for the Asian kadam tree. If they were different (in spite of Richard&#39;s claim that they were the same) then <em>Anthocephalus</em> could be a generic name for the kadam tree. Based on the latter view, the name <em>Anthocephalus chinensis</em>    has been widely used for the kadam tree.The current view taken by most taxonomic sources is that Richard&#39;s <em>Anthocephalus indicus</em> or <em>Anthocephalus chinensis</em> is a synonym of <em>Cephalanthus chinensis</em> (now transferred to the
    genus (Lam.) Capuron), and that the widespread use of <em>Anthocephalus chinensis</em> for the kadam tree is an error. (This erroneous sense of the scientific name is shown by writing <em>A. chinensis</em> auct., where &quot;auct.&quot; is an abbreviation
    of the Latin for &quot;of authors&quot;, i.e. rather than of the correct authority.)Given that Richard&#39;s name for the kadam tree is incorrect, the earliest name is 1824 <em>Nauclea cadamba</em>. In 1984,  created the new generic name <em>Neolamarckia</em>,
    honouring Lamarck, for the Asian genus which matched Richard&#39;s description of his <em>Anthocephalus</em>, transferring <em>Nauclea cadamba</em> as <em>Neolamarckia cadamba</em> (Roxb.) Bosser. However, not all botanical sources have accepted this
    taxonomic analysis and the name <em>Anthocephalus</em> is still in use for the Asian genus.. <br><br>Uses <br>The fruit and inflorescences are reportedly edible by humans. The fresh leaves are fed to cattle. <em>N. lamarckia</em> is grown as an  and for low-grade
    timber and paper. The timber is used for plywood, light construction, pulp and paper, boxes and crates, dug-out canoes, and furniture components. Kadamba yields a pulp of satisfactory brightness and performance as a hand sheet. The wood can be easily
    impregnated with synthetic resins to increase its density .The wood has a density of 290–560 kg/cu m at 15% moisture content, a fine to medium texture; straight grain; low luster and has no characteristic odor or taste. It is easy to work, with hand
    and machine tools, cuts cleanly, gives a very good surface and is easy to nail. The timber air dries rapidly with little or no degrade. Kadamba wood is very easy to preserve using either open tank or pressure-vacuum systems.Kadamba is one of the most
    frequently planted trees in the tropics. The tree is grown along avenues, roadsides and villages for shade. Kadamba are suitable for reforestation programs. It sheds large amounts of leaf and non-leaf litter which on decomposition improves some physical
    and of soil under its canopy. This reflects an increase in the level of soil organic carbon,  available plant nutrients and exchangeable bases.A yellow dye is obtained from the root bark. Kadamba flowers are an important raw material in the production
    of ‘attar’, which is Indian perfume with (<em>Santalum</em> spp.) base in which one of the essences is absorbed through hydro-distillation. An extract of the leaves serves as a mouth gargle.The leaf extract has recently been used to produce . </p>
