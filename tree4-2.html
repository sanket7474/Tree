    <p class="lead text-left text-info"><strong><em>Dalbergia sissoo</em> is a decidious tree with an open spreading crown that reaches a height between 15-35 metres (Duke, 1983). The trunk is often crooked (Duke, 1983) with thin, grey bark, furrowed and exfoliating in narrow strips as it matures (ICRAF, undated). It has a long taproot and an extensive lateral root system, often at the soil surface and producing suckers (PIER, 2006). The leaves are alternately arranged, compound and oddly pinnate (Gilman &amp; Watson, 1993), with 3-5 glabrous, leathery leaflets, elliptical to ovate, tapering to a point and 2.5-3.6cm in diameter (ICRAF, undated). Flowers are sessile (PIER, 2006), arranged in axillary panicles, 2.5-3.7cm long, inconspicuous, white to dull yellow (ICRAF, undated). Flowers are fragrant (PIER, 2006), with pubescent sepals 4-5mm long, and petals 6-8mm long (Duke, 1983). Fruits are indehiscent, 5-7.5cm long and 8-13mm wide (ICRAF, undated), rounded with minute points, pale brown in colour (PIER, 2006), and persistent on the tree (Gilman &amp; Watson, 1993). The seed is kidney-shaped, thin, flat, and light brown with 1-4 seeds in a pod (ICRAF, undated). </strong></p>

    class="lead text-left text-info"><strong><em>Dalbergia sissoo</em> has a wide range of economic and ecological uses. The wood of Indian rosewood is highly durable with excellent finishing colour and smoothness; used for veneer, furniture, cabinets, panelling, carving, small timber, plywood and musical instruments (ICRAF, undated; Lowry &amp; Seebeck, 1997). The sawdust works in the absorption of nickel ions and has the potential of removing these heavy metals from industrial and commercial waste water sources (Habib-ur-Rehman,<em>et al</em>, 2006). The wood has a high caloric content and is an important fuelwood and charcoal source (Sheikh, 1989). The wood fibres are processed into a pulp that is further made into paper (ICRAF, undated). A non-drying fixed oil is processed from the heartwood and used as a lubricant in heavy machinery (ICRAF, undated). The leaves and young shoots can be used as fodder for livestock and grazing animals typically in winter seasons when other fodder is not available (Sheikh, 1989). The tree has many reputed medicinal properties and have been used culturally for a variety of ailments including: skin diseases, blood diseases, syphilis, stomach problems, dysentry, nausea, eye and nose disorders, aphrodisiac, expectorant, among others (Duke, 1983). Indian rosewood also has insecticidal and larvicidal properties, as well as resistance to some wood boring insects (ICRAF, undated).&nbsp;Ecologically Indian rosewood provides numerous servives to the landscape and environment and is commonly employed in agroforestry (Lowry &amp; Seebeck, 1997). It is used as a windbreak and shelter belt and as a shade tree in intercropping of orchards, mango, tea, and coffee plantations (ICRAF, undated; Sharma,<em>et al</em>, 2000). Since it has an aggressive root system and is prone to suckering it is commonly used for erosion control and soil stabilization along stream and river banks (ICRAF, undated). It is widely planted in its native countries for reforestation programs (Sharma,<em>et al</em>, 2000). It is also valued for its ability to increase soil fertility through nitrogen fixation and is intercropped for these reasons as well (ICRAF, undated). Highly valued for its fragrant flowers and shade it is planted in urban areas along roadsides and in gardens as an ornamental (Gilman &amp; Watson, 1993). </strong></p>
