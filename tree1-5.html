    <p class="lead text-left text-info"><strong>This is the palm which produces to popular betel-nut or supari, which is an essential ingradient of paan. It is a medium-sized tree growing to 20 m tall, with a trunk 20-30 cm in diameter. The leaves are 1.5-2 m long, pinnate, with numerous, crowded leaflets. It is grown for its economically important seed crop, the Betel nut. The seed contains alkaloids such as arecaine and arecoline, which when chewed is intoxicating and is also slightly addictive. Flowers are unisexual, with both male and female  flowers borne in the same inflorescence. Inflorescences are crowded, much-branched panicles borne below the leaves. Each terminal branch has a few female flowers borne at the base and numerous male flowers extending from there out to the branch tip. Flowers of both sexes have six tepals, are stalkless, creamy-white, fragrant; male flowers are minute, deciduous,  have six stamens, arrowhead-shaped anthers, rudimentary ovary; female  flowers are larger (1.2–2 cm long), with six small sterile stamens and a  three-celled ovary bearing a  triangular stigma with three points at the  apex. Fibrous, ovoid fruits, yellow to orange or red when ripe, contain the betel nut. </strong></p>
    <p class="lead text-left text-info"><strong>BOTANIC DESCRIPTION <br>Arecanut is an erect, unbranched palm reaching heights of 12-30 m, depending upon the environmental conditions. The stem, marked with scars of fallen leaves in a regular annulated form, becomes visible only when the palm is about 3 years old. Girth depends on genetic variation and soil conditions. Root system adventitious, typical of monocots.The adult palm has 7-12 open leaves, each with a sheath, a rachis and leaflets. The leaf stalk extends as the midrib until the end of the leaf and ends as leaflets.Male flowers very numerous, sessile, without bracts; calyx 1-leaved, small, 3-cornered, 3-parted; petals 3, oblong, rigid striated; stamens 6, anthers sagittate. Female flowers solitary or 2 or 3 at or near the base of each ramification of the spadix, sessile, without bracts; sepals permanent; staminodes 6, connate, styles scarcely any; stigmas 3, short, triangular.Fruit a monolocular, one-seeded berry, 3.8-5 cm long, smooth orange or scarlet when ripe, with a fibrous outer layer.The generic name is derived from the common name used by the people of the Malabar Coast in southwestern India.<br><br>BIOLOGY <br>Arecanut palm is a monoecious plant with male and female flowers occurring on the same spadix. Every year 3-4 inflorescences are produced. The first inflorescence on young palms may produce only male flowers. The male flowers open for a few hours, shedding pollen most in the morning; bees and other insects collect this. The average male flowering period is 2-4 weeks; after this the stigmas in female flowers become receptive for 3-4 days. The sweet-scented male flowers are visited by bees and other insects for nectar, but insects have not been observed visiting the female flowers. It is thought that most of the flowers are wind pollinated. <br><br>PRODUCTS <br>Fibre:  The husk fibres are predominantly composed of cellulose with varying proportions of hemi-cellulose, lignin, pectin and protopectin. Based on various tests, it has been proposed that the husk fibre could be used in making such items as thick boards, fluffy cushions and non-woven fabrics. Trial experiments have shown that satisfactory yield and quality of brown wrapping paper could be prepared from blends of arecanut and bamboo or banana pseudostem pulp.<br>Timber: Arecanut stem forms a useful building material in the villages, and it is widely used throughout southeast Asia for a variety of construction purposes. The timber can also be used in making a variety of utility articles such as rulers, shelves and waste paper baskets. Nails made from areca stem are widely used in the furniture industry.<br>Tannin or dyestuff:  Long before the nature and properties of tannins were determined, the tannins in arecanut were being used for dyeing clothes, as adhesives in plywood manufacture, and for tanning leather for home use in southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean countries. The tannins are obtained as a byproduct in preparing immature betelnuts for chewing.<br>Lipids: The nut contains 8-12% fat that has characteristics comparable with hydrogenated coconut oil. It contains both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Arecanut fat can be extracted by using hexane as a solvent, and the fat can be made edible by refining it with an alkali. Simple blending of arecanut fat with butterfat followed by inter-esterification gives good products, acceptable in confectioneries.<br>Alcohol: Innoculated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the leaves of arecanut can be used as a fermentation stimulant in industrial alcohol production.<br>Poison: The arecanut decoction as well as arecoline and its salts have been found to be effective on various helminth infections such as those caused by Taenia spp.<br>Medicine: Arecanut is used against anaemia, fits, leucoderma, leprosy, obesity and worms. In combination with other ingredients, it is also a purgative and an ointment for nasal ulcers. Kernels of green and mature fruits are chewed as an astringent and stimulant, often with the leaves or fruit of betel pepper (Piper betle) and lime.<br>Other products:  Arecanut husk can be a good source of furfural. Possibilities of producing activated carbon from the husks have been investigated, and yields of 25-28% have been recorded.<br>SERVICES Soil improver:  The arecanut leaves are a good source of organic manure, containing nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium.Ornamental: In Florida and Hawaii, arecanut is used as an ornamental tree.Intercropping: Experimental evidence indicates that intercropping with arecanut is not harmful to the main crop. When intercropped with black pepper, it acts as a live standard for training the pepper plants. Banana, cardamom, cowpea, paddy, pineapple, sorghum, vegetables and yams are also grown by farmers as intercrops with arecanut</strong></p>
