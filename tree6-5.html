    <p class="lead text-left text-info"><strong>Oriental arborvitae is a densely branched evergreen conifer that can get as much as 50 ft (15.2 m) tall with a spread of 20 ft (6.1 m), but in cultivation usually grows as a smaller, bushier shrub. It tends to have several to many stems, but can be trimmed to a single leader stem creating a treelike form. The overall shape is conical, with the crown becoming more irregular and spreading with age. The bark is rusty-brown and fibrous. The numerous slender ascending branches support shoots that spread out in flat, vertical planes. The leaves are like little scales overlapping and tightly packed on the shoots. The oblong cones are about 1 in (2.5 cm) long, held upright, and blue-green with a grayish waxy bloom. The cones are fleshy at first, becoming woody as they mature, and each of the 6-8 scales that cover the cone has a recurved, fleshy hook. Under the scales are wingless seeds.Oriental arborvitae is a densely branched evergreen conifer that can get as much as 50 ft (15.2 m) tall with a spread of 20 ft (6.1 m), but in cultivation usually grows as a smaller, bushier shrub.
